                They are dynamic websites that offer interactive services to users through web browsers. 
                In contrast to static websites, which only display content, web applications provide a variety of functions by interacting with back-end systems. 
                This interaction mainly involves communicating with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

            <h3>Components of Web Applications.

                Front-End: This is the part of the application that users interact with. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes elements such as forms, buttons, and navigation menus.
                Back-End: The back-end manages the application's business logic, database interactions, authentication, and authorization. It's developed using server-side languages like Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js.
                Database: Databases store the data used and generated by the web application. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

            <h4>Interaction Between Web Applications and Databases.

                The interaction between web applications and databases occurs mainly through back-end processes. 
                Here is a simplified flow of how this interaction typically works:
                User Request: A user interacts with the front end, such as by submitting a form to register or log in. 
                Front-End Processing: The front-end collects the user input and sends it to the back-end via HTTP requests. 
                Back-End Processing: The back-end server receives the request, processes it, and interacts with the database as needed. Fetching user data or inserting new records.
                Database Operations: The database executes the requested operations. For example, an SQL query is run to retrieve user details. 
                Response to Front-End: After the database operation, the back-end sends the appropriate response back to the front-end.
                Update User Interface: The front end updates the user interface based on the response received, providing feedback to the user.
